**Note:** This one was truly multiple choice, i.e. multiple answers were given.

a) Q: Backpropagation is an algorithm whose primary and direct purpose is to ...

A: efficiently compute the gradients occurring in neural network training

b) Q: Support vectors are ...

A: the points which define the separating hyperplane.

c) Q: Gradient descent is an optimization method that ...

A: can find the global minimum of a function under some assumptions on the function.
**Note**: The assumption on the function is that the function is convex.

d) Q: Linear machine learning algorithms ...

A: can be turned into non-linear algorithms by using an upstream mapping (in g(f(x)) f is an upstream mapping to g).
**Note**: Isn't kernelizing the same? with the kernel phi(x)?
or
A: can be turned into non-linear algorithms only if they can be kernelized.
**Note**: The `only if` feels a little too restrictive.


e) Q: Kernels are functions that ...

A: efficiently compute inner products.
