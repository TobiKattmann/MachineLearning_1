# Exam preparation

In this folder the contents of Machine Learning 1 (Prof. Kloft, TU Kaiserslautern) are structured based on topic.
Slides, exercise solutions, exam tasks and additional information for a specific topic (e.g. SVM) are concentrated in one place.

If not further specified the slides and exercises are from SS21.
Slides and Excercise Solution from SS20 are also added in a subfolder for each topic.
An additional `README.md` in such subfolder documents possible differences between the two years.

This kind of `README.md` documentation is also done for the `ExamTasks` in each topic as they are not always unique.
